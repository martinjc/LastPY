Last.FM API bindings for Python. v0.1

This is very much still a work in progress. There will be bugs, and it's messy, and there's no documentation or comments. Use at your own peril.

Example usage:

auth = lastpy.LastpyAuthHandler(session_key, api_key, api_secret)
api = lastpy.API(auth)
user = api.user_getinfo(user='rj')

Many thanks to Joshua Roesslein for his work on Tweepy, which greatly inspired the design of this API wrapper. Uses portions of Tweepy code throughout.
